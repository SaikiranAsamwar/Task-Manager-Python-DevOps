# DEPRECATED: Frontend deployment removed
# The application now uses a single-container architecture where
# the Flask backend serves both API endpoints and frontend templates.
# 
# All traffic should be routed to the app-service (backend-deployment.yaml)
# which handles both frontend and backend functionality.
#
# If you need a separate reverse proxy or load balancer, deploy Nginx
# separately and configure it to proxy all requests to app-service:5000
